This is a blog dedicated to displaying student final projects in Geography 167 AC. The final project is about student exploring the histories, migration patterns, other interesting features of their neighborhood and connecting them to what they learned in the class. 

This site is created by [Parshant Juneja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parshant-juneja-7a19b2140/){:target="_blank"}(former Geog 167 AC student) as a token of appreciation for Professor Diana.
